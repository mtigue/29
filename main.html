  <p>
  <strong>How do I discern?</strong><br>
 The best first step in this sometimes difficult process is to follow the words most spoken in the Holy Scripture, “Be not afraid!” Whether it was an angel announcing good news, or Christ speaking to His disciples, setting aside your fear is the fist step. Once you are open to hearing the Lord speak to your heart, a message that will most likely come as a quiet whisper, you will be able to truly discern, figure out, ‘Lord, where are you calling me to serve you in this life?’
  </p>
<p>

Discernment must involve prayer, the willingness to seek out quiet in an otherwise noisy world, a desire to know God’s will for your life, and a love for the Church and all Her members. Discernment is the first step in coming to know if the Lord is calling you to serve him as a Roman Catholic priest.

                    <h3>Steps for Discernment</h3>
                    
                    <div class="text-info">
               
                  
     <p>While there are  several methods of discerning God’s calling in your life, the following steps  will hopefully assist you with this process:</p>
  
  <h3><strong>You must  have a personal relationship with Christ</strong></h3>
  <p>As Pope Benedict states: “The seminarian experiences the beauty of  God’s call in a moment of grace which could be defined as ‘falling in love’….It  is only when a young man has had a personal experience of Christ that he can  truly understand the Lord’s will and consequently his own vocation.” Have you  fallen ‘in love’ with Christ?</p>
  
  <h3><strong>Pray for  guidance from God</strong></h3>
  <p>God has a plan for everyone and following God’s plan will lead to  true happiness. Allow the Lord to lead you and have trust that He will only  desire what is best for you. It is then that you will find true happiness and  fulfillment in life.</p>
  
  <h3><strong>Pay  attention to the gifts and talents you’ve been given by God</strong></h3>
  <p>God has blessed each of us with many gifts and talents, distinct  to every person. Have you allowed yourself the ability to consider that these  gifts that you have been blessed with from God could be used to serve the  Church?</p>
  
  <h3><strong>Pray  before the Blessed Sacrament for guidance</strong></h3>
  <p>The Real Presence of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Eucharist is the  ‘source and summit’ of our Catholic faith. What better place to spend time in  quiet reflection and adoration then in the presence of our living God? “This is  Jesus here. This is God. And priests exist to make him sacramentally present to  the faithful.” Seek out a parish that has an adoration chapel and enjoy your  time of grace in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament.</p>
  
  <h3><strong>Seek  advice from a priest</strong></h3>
  <p>While many people are well equipped to assist you in your  discernment of a priestly vocation, there is no substitute for a priest.  Whether it is one of your parish priests, a spiritual director, or friend, the  advice and direction received from a priest will be extremely beneficial in  your discernment of a calling to the priesthood of Jesus Christ.</p>
  
  <h3><strong>Receive  the sacraments of Eucharist and Reconciliation </strong></h3>
  <p>Regular reception of the Eucharist, definitely every Sunday and  preferably every day if your schedule allows, will afford you the opportunity  to stay in communion with the ‘Word made Flesh’. Unlike other food, the more  you receive the Eucharist, the more you become like that which you consume. The  sacrament of Reconciliation reminds you that we are all sinners and always in  need of God’s merciful forgiveness. The more we receive forgiveness for our  sins, the better we can configure our lives to Christ.</p>
  
  <h3><strong>Know God,  know true peace</strong></h3>
  <p>True peace will be felt in your heart when you come to know God as  an intimate friend. This peace will also lead to an affirmation that what you  are experiencing emotionally in regards to your discernment of the priesthood is  from God. Knowing what and where God wants you to be will come with an  overwhelming sense of peace.</p>
  
  <h3><strong>Look to  Jesus as the model for all decision making</strong>.</h3>
  <p>“Father…not my will, but Yours be done.” (Luke 22:42) By seeking  God’s perfect will, life to the fullest will be experienced. Jesus always  followed the will of His Father, are we not called to do the same?</p>
  
  <h3><strong>Be  involved in the life of your parish</strong></h3>
  <p>An excellent way to experience the life of a parish priest is to  involve yourself in the life of a parish…..which is the life of a priest.  Consider being an Extraordinary Minister of the Eucharist, Lector, Catechist or  a member of a Committee, Commission or Council. The more you know about the  life of a priest, the better you will be able to discern.</p>
  
  <h3><strong>Contact  your vocation director</strong></h3>
  <p>While it is always important to consult other people you know and  trust, if you are feeling an attraction to the priesthood ‘at some level’, it  is in your best interest to contact your vocation director. He will be a priest  that will help you to better discern God’s calling in your life. He will also  have programs available to assist you in your discernment.</p>

                  <h3>Why is Discernment Important?</h3>
                  
  <div class="text-info">
  
  <p>
The process of making a decision about your life with the help of the Holy Spirit is called "discernment." It is the process of discovering God's will for you. “Ultimately, our vocation consists in God calling us to consummate loving union with the Father, Son and Holy Spirit for all eternity.”
</p>
 <p> 
As you begin, remember that both you and God ultimately desire the same thing - your happiness. You want to make a decision about your life that will bring you happiness.

</p>
 <p> 
Therefore, you and God are not working at cross-purposes, but for the same goal. Discernment is a gift from God, assisting you in the ability to “come to know, identify or recognize one thing as distinct from something else.”

</p>
 <p>
Discernment begins with the ability to ask without fear, “Lord, how can I best serve you?” Only after you are willing to ask this question can true discernment begin.

              <strong>How do you define "vocation"?    </strong><br>          
              A vocation is a call from God to do something specifically for God and for His kingdom. The primary vocation of every person is to be holy! It is the divine calling to love and serve God, to obey His commandments, and to cooperate with Christ in the work of redemption by loving and serving others. But we are all called to a secondary vocation as well, a "state in life" in which we are to be holy.

              <p>
              <strong>What are some of these "secondary" vocations that I might be called to follow?</strong><br>
         Many people are called to the vocation of marriage, but it is an error to automatically assume that this is your vocation. One may also be called to the vocation of the priesthood, to the religious life as a sister or brother, or to the diaconate. Finally, some are called by Christ to the single state. Remember: It is normal to desire marriage and family. Just because you have this desire does not exclude the possibility that you have a vocation to the priesthood.            </p>

              <strong>Can I be happy in my life if I do not follow God's plan for me? <br>
</strong>            
			  If you do not follow the vocation for which God made you, you can attain a certain degree of happiness in this world, and still attain salvation (go to heaven), but you can never be as happy as you might have been, had you followed your proper vocation. This is why it is so important that you discern correctly. Of course, there are trials and tribulations in every vocation. To become a priest does not take away all suffering. But there is great joy in laying down one's life for Jesus!           </p>

              <strong>How do I know what God is calling me to do?</strong><br>
              
         
        You must pray every single day, asking God to reveal His plan for you. Do not ask yourself, "What do I want to do when I grow up?" This is the wrong question! Rather, you should be thinking and asking: "Jesus, what do You want me to do?" And listen for the answer! The primary area of revelation is the heart. Listen with your heart!
 </p> <p>
The discernment process in the priesthood must also include the Church. The local bishop is the one who ultimately decides who is and who is not called. He is assisted in this by the Vocation Office and the seminary. This whole process is called "discerning one's vocation."       </p>

              Possibly, but not necessarily. A man must pray a great deal, listening with both heart and soul to know what God wants him to do. But if you feel some attraction at this point, just continue to pray, go to Mass, and live a Christian life. If you are living a Christian life, Jesus will let you know when the time comes. Also, go talk with your parish priest or with the vocation director. Try to come to the diocesan-sponsored retreats and discernment nights. The vocation director can help you determine if God is calling you to the priesthood.     </p>

             Does the vocation director call you every day to badger you about becoming a priest? Do you get put on a mailing list? Will your friends or your mom find out? </p>
     <p>
Not at all! Feel free to call confidentially, and ask any question you like. Give as much or as little information about yourself as you choose. It's a normal part of a vocation director's job to talk to guys at all levels of discernment. </p>
     <p>
Lots of men inquire about the priesthood, and for a number of reasons. A small percentage are seriously interested in applying to the seminary. Many are just satisfying their curiosity. Others are inquiring about what a particular diocese is like. </p>

If you feel a nudge from God to do something about your attraction to the priesthood, take a step in faith!     </p>

              Holiness (to be like Jesus) is a lifetime endeavor for every person in every vocation. Don't worry if you don't see yourself as very holy right now. God will form you slowly, day by day and week by week, so that you will be ready to be His instrument when the time comes. But for now, use the sacrament of Penance at least once a month. Repent of your sins, receive the sacraments, and pray every day. You will be surprised at how Christ-like you can become!         </p>

              <strong>Will I be lonely if I become a priest?</strong><br>
              Loneliness is a part of every vocation, at one time or another. It is part of the human condition. Married people get very lonely at times, even though they are surrounded by their spouses and children. Priests are always surrounded by people. This is one of the joys of being a priest. We are involved with people at the most profound moments of their lives: birth, Baptism, Confirmation, First Communion, Marriage, and death. We don't have enough time to experience loneliness often! But when we do experience loneliness, Jesus can fill that void, as He does for people in every vocation.        </p>

              <strong>What does a priest do?</strong><br>
              The purpose of a priest is to bring people to Jesus, and Jesus to people. He does this primarily by preaching the Word and offering the Sacrifice of the Mass. His daily life involves administering the sacraments—Baptism, Confirmation, the Eucharist, Penance and Reconciliation, the Anointing of the Sick, and Matrimony (Holy Orders is reserved for bishops to administer)—and caring for the people in their daily needs.       </p>

              <strong>Is it easy to become a priest?</strong><br>
            No, it is definitely not easy! A man who wants to become a priest must go to college for four years, with at least two years of philosophy. After graduating from college, he must go to a seminary for another four years to earn a master's degree in divinity. Most men go to school eight to ten years after high school, before they are ordained a priest! But do not let this discourage you. God always gives us the grace to do what He asks us to do.    </p>

              <strong>Are most priests happy in their vocation - in their lives and in their work for Christ?</strong><br>
          Most priests are extremely happy in their vocation! The life of a priest is a very rewarding life, both in this world and in the next. The media often gives an incorrect impression of priests… that they are largely unhappy, frustrated, and angry. This is simply not true. A recent nationwide poll was conducted of priests and 87% report being very satisfied with their vocation…..the highest such statistic of any profession!    </p>

          A priest can do anything he wants for recreation, as long as it is consistent with the Christian life. Many priests play golf, basketball, softball, scuba dive, and engage in other sports. Others enjoy movies, plays, and reading. Some like to hunt, fish, and every other imaginable entertainment!   </p>

              <strong>Do priests get paid?</strong><br>
         Priests do not get paid in the sense that people in the business world are paid. Because a priest does not have a family and because he lives a simple life, he does not need a lot of money. However, priests do receive a salary, which provides him with enough money to buy the necessities, to buy and maintain an automobile, to take a vacation, and to do normal recreational activities. Also, priests are given free room and board by the church for which they work, so their expenses are minimal.  </p>

              <strong>Is the daily life of the priest interesting?</strong><br>
         There is never a dull moment in the priesthood! It is a great challenge but it is also extremely rewarding. When a priest goes to bed each night, he can say, "Lord, today I spent myself for You." What a wonderful thought with which to end one's day! The priesthood is both interesting and fulfilling because people are so interesting. But these people need more priests very badly.</p>

              <strong>Why can't priests get married?</strong><br>
       Catholic priests in the Latin Rite do not get married so as to dedicate themselves completely to Jesus and to His people. Priests generate "spiritual children" by bringing many souls to Christ and helping them to grow in holiness so that they can one day live forever in Heaven. The sacrifice of celibacy (not getting married) is a sign to the world that only Jesus can give us the happiness that we all so crave. Giving up something as important as marriage and family is a powerful sign to the world that Jesus Christ is real! He is worth living for and sacrificing for. No, it is not easy, but neither is marriage. The fact is, every vocation requires great personal sacrifice. And there is great joy in sacrifice when it is done for Jesus and for others! As one priest said: "It is true that no one will ever call me 'daddy.' But thousands call me 'Father.'"</p>

      It is possible that this law of the Church will one day be changed. If the Holy Spirit wants this change, He will affect it through the Pope and bishops of the world. However, it would be a grave mistake to go to the seminary "expecting" this change. That would be setting oneself up for a big disappointment, should it not happen.</p>

              <strong>Don't you think more men would become priests if they could get married? Wouldn't that solve the priest shortage?</strong><br>
     Perhaps more men would choose the priesthood, but the question is, "Would this be what is best for the Church?" As said above, celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom is a powerful sign that Jesus is real and that He is worth living for, sacrificing for, and dying for. Besides, in the world as a whole, vocations to the priesthood and religious life have dramatically increased in the last thirty years. In Africa, they increased by 394%; in S. E. Asia, by 152%; in Central America, by 165%; and in South America, by 253%! It is only in the U. S. and in Western Europe that they dropped by 60% and 13%, respectively. The problem is not the requirement of celibacy … there is something else going on in our nation and in Western Europe.</p>

             Seminary: A house of formation where men who are discerning a vocation to the priesthood are formed into holy and dedicated priests.

</p><p>
Pope John Paul II described seminary formation as "a continuation in the Church of the apostolic community gathered about Jesus, listening to his word, proceeding towards the Easter experience, awaiting the gift of the Spirit for the mission." (PPF7)              
              </p>

                    <h3>What is a Seminarian?</h3>

              <p>
              <strong>What is a Seminarian?</strong><br>
              
        A seminarian is a man who is discerning the Lord's call to the ministerial Roman Catholic Priesthood. By virtue of his baptism, he is a member of the priesthood of all believers. The seminarian hears the Lord speaking to him and calling him to a fuller participation in the priesthood, by becoming a priest of Jesus Christ. While the priesthood has many elements that make it like a job, it is ultimately a vocation: a calling from the Lord. The seminarian then needs to be open to hearing the Lord's call in his life and be eager to respond to it.
</p>
<p>
A man who enters the seminary does not possess all the answers. In fact, many more questions will arise from time spent in seminary formation! Seminarians come from all walks of life, previous educational experiences, family backgrounds and parishes. They bring different talents, insights, and experiences to their time in formation. In the Program for Priestly Formation, the bishops write,
</p>

<blockquote>
"All applicants should give witness to their conviction that God has brought them to the seminary to discern whether or not they are really called to the priesthood, and they should commit themselves wholeheartedly to carrying out that discernment.  (PPF 45)
</blockquote>

<p>
Seminarians live in community. This means they pray together, work together, eat together, and study together. While the seminary is a place where individual men go to discern what the Lord is asking of them, ultimately as priests they will belong to a fraternity. The seeds of this brotherhood and fraternity are sown during time in seminary formation. Again, from the Program for Priestly Formation,
</p>
<blockquote>
"The essential work of the seminary takes place in the context of community. Personal growth and character development should progress together harmoniously within a deepening spiritual life. The seminary is a school of human virtue, of growth in honesty, integrity, intellectual rigor, hard work, and tolerance, where the common good is built with solidarity and discipline—all leavened by humor and healthy enjoyment. The seminary also must be a school of spiritual growth in which seminarians are formed into men of prayer, imbued with those virtues that only grace can bring: faith, hope, and charity. The seminary should help the seminarians develop the relationship and dialogue skills necessary for healthy interpersonal relationships as priests." (PPF 260)
</blockquote>

              <strong>Am I ready for the seminary? <br>
</strong>            

</p>
<p>
	  Entering the seminary is a big step in a man’s life, but it is also important to remember that it is also a small step at the same time. By deciding to enter the seminary, you are simply stating, “I feel the Lord is calling me to discern the vocation of priesthood.” This is a big step because you will have for the first time stated publicly that you are seeking to discern a priestly vocation. Friends and family will react in different ways to this declaration, but don’t let that worry you…..always remember the phrase most spoken in all of scripture, ‘Be Not Afraid!”
 </p>
 <p>
It is a small step, because you will have made no other commitment other than a willingness to spend the next year discerning a calling to the priesthood with the support and assistance of the seminary faculty, and your brother seminarians who both afford you the opportunity to no longer embark on this discernment alone.
 </p>
 <p>
If you discern, through the guidance of your spiritual director, that you are not called to the priesthood, what have you lost? A year or two, or three spent learning more about yourself, your spiritual life, your Church, your vocation….all this goes with you. If your discernment leads you to the sacrament of Holy Orders, you will have found your mission in life. Either way, it is a win-win, or as some would say, time well spent. Ask the vast majority of men who have spent time in the seminary discerning their vocation, and they will tell you it was some of the best years of their lives!          </p>

             An application for the seminary is one that the Director of Vocations is happy to distribute, but there are a few preliminary steps that must be completed first. The very first step in this process is to 
			  <a href="#contact">contact the Director of Vocations</a> for the Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon. You must first be accepted by the Archdiocese of Portland before applying to a seminary. </p>

<p>
After you are accepted then the conversation will lead to the following: 
<ul>
    <li>The Vocations Director will ask you to apply for a particular seminary. </li>
    <li>You will then have interviews with the Rector, priest-faculty of the particular seminary. </li>
    <li>acceptance by the seminary allows you to begin your seminary training.</li>
</ul>

              <strong>What is a vocation?</strong><br>          
              
      The root word for vocation is vocare, which is Latin for "to call." God has created each one of us for a particular calling or way to follow Him. Through the Sacrament of Baptism we become a child of God and thus called to live in holiness through love of God and neighbor. It is important to also remember that our true vocation does not come from the world, but rather is an invitation directly from God to follow Him.
 </p>
 
 <p>
Our first or primary vocation is to live in holiness, or in other words, to become a saint! While this is a challenge for us all, it should be the goal of every baptized child of God.
 </p><p>
Our particular vocation then becomes our state in life: Priesthood, Consecrated Life, Marriage or Single Life.
 </p><p>
Learning what our particular vocation will be requires a process we call discernment. It will be utilized at various stages in our lives and God will use others to assist us in that process.
 </p>
 <p>
Do you have the courage to ask God the question that is seldom uttered in our busy world, “Lord how are you calling me to follow You?”
 </p>
 
 <blockquote>
"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 
For everyone who asks, receives, and the one who seeks, finds; and the one who knocks the door will be opened." -Matthew 7:7-8

                    <h3>Qualities of a Priest</h3>
                    
                    <div class="text-info">
              
              
             <h3> A Priest is a man of Prayer</h3>
             The priest is first and foremost a man of prayer. The priest lives ‘in persona Christi’ so his most important prayer is to re-present the sacrifice of Jesus during Holy Mass. His parish relies on him to offer a sacrifice "holy and acceptable to God." Throughout the week, too, at parish meetings and community functions, he is often asked: "Father, will you lead us in prayer?" He is seen as a man who knows how to speak with God.
 <p>
A priest spends each day in personal prayer through the Liturgy of the Hours and time in private meditation before the Blessed Sacrament. His private prayer is essential, for he must know Him of whom he speaks, teaches and preaches; he must come to have an intimate relationship with Christ. The priest becomes ‘another Christ’ for his people.
          </p>
          

<h3>   
      A Priest is a preacher of the Word</h3> 
Since the beginning of Christianity, people have come to Jesus through the preaching of the Word. Today, this remains a primary ministry of a priest. Because the majority of Catholics encounter the faith and receive their inspiration to practice it from the preaching of their parish priest, men who can articulate their knowledge and excitement about their Faith are a great treasure to the Church. A priest's duty, then, is to teach his people how Christ's life is relevant to their own. He answers the question, "How can I live out my faith today?"
 
 <blockquote>
 <em>
 "The Church faces a particularly difficult task in her efforts to preach the word of God in all cultures in which the faithful are constantly challenged by consumerism and a pleasure-seeking mentality." (Pope John Paul II)    </em>    </blockquote>
              
              
              
              
   

<h3>
A Priest is a Servant</h3>
A priest is not a priest for himself. The ordained priest shares in the mission of Jesus as Priest, Prophet and King. As priest, he prays and celebrates the Eucharist. As prophet, he preaches and teaches the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and as king, he serves others.
 <p>
At the Last Supper, Jesus gave the Eucharistic mandate to His apostles, "Do this in memory of me," but not before the Lord had knelt down and washed their feet. Jesus said, "What I have done for you, you must do for one another."
</p> <p>
A priest must be a servant to God's people. He brings the love and strength of Christ into the parish, the school, the hospital room, the prison, the ghetto…wherever God's people are and especially wherever they suffer, the priest is there.

                    <h3>What about Celibacy</h3>
                    
                    <div class="text-info">
              
            
              <strong>What about Celibacy <br>
</strong>            
  <p>
<strong>Celibacy:</strong> The state of being unmarried, specifically for the sake of giving oneself full time to build the Kingdom of God. This is a gift from God, to which a man must be called. Presently, to be called to the priesthood in the Latin Roman Catholic Church is also a call to celibacy.
 </p><p>
<strong>Chastity: </strong>“The successful integration of sexuality within the person and thus the inner unity of man in his bodily and spiritual person and thus inner unity of man in his bodily and spiritual being.” (CCC#2337) Chastity is the virtue that moderates the desire for sexual pleasure according to the principles of faith and right reason. Priests, Sisters, married persons, and single persons are called by God to chastity, to use their sexuality according to God’s plan in their specific state in life."

	     </p>
Are some of these your questions in regards to celibacy?
  <ul>
 <li>“I really like girls!”</li> 
<li>“I have not always lived a chaste life. Can I still be considered for the seminary?”</li> 
<li>“I struggle with purity, so I’m not sure I possess the holiness that is required for a commitment to celibacy.”</li> 
<li>“Celibacy seems like a life of loneliness…will I be happy alone?”</li> 
<li>“I think I still want to be a father?”	     </li> 
	     
	   </ul>
	     
<p>
“The requirement of celibacy is certainly one of the greatest sources of anxiety and fear in a man who is discerning priesthood. This is especially true in a sex-saturated society and culture. The message we receive from the media and culture is very clear: no person can be happy and fulfilled unless they are having a lot of sex. But this is simply not true.”</p>
 <p>
“The good news is that God’s grace can accomplish all things! With the power of Jesus’ cross, a man can overcome sexual lust and live his life peacefully in his respective vocation. It can be done. It is possible. There is much evidence. For example, there are approximately four hundred thousand Catholic priests worldwide. The huge majority of these men at one time said these or similar words, “I can never become a priest because I like girls too much.” Well, all four hundred thousand of them are priests now. God will never send us where His grace cannot sustain us.”

                    <h3>Are Priests happy?</h3>
                    
                    <div class="text-info">
              
          
      <p>The  overwhelming majority of priests are extremely happy in their vocations! Why?  Because they are doing what the Lord intended for their lives…for their  vocation. &nbsp;Most priests will cite administering the Sacraments, preaching  the Word, and helping people and their families as great sources of  satisfaction.* &nbsp;Ultimately, the source of happiness for any child of God is his or her  relationship with Jesus Christ and the priest is given the privilege of acting  in the person of Christ at key moments in the life of the Church.</p>
 
  <p> You  might ask….do you have any facts to back this up?  In an upcoming study to be published in  October 2011 by Msgr. Stephen Rossetti, “<em>Why Priests Are Happy: A  Study of the Psychological and Spiritual Health of Priests”, </em><em>reports that </em><strong> 92% of priests say they are happy in the ministry. </strong>More information can be found about this study below.**<br />
    The  Holy Father, Pope Benedict XVI, also had this to say to a group of young people  on a pilgrimage regarding how to find true happiness….something that priests  will say they have found:<br />
    A &quot;yes&quot; to God opens the font of happiness,  says Benedict XVI. </p>
  
  <p>Benedict XVI called on young people to imitate Mary's  response when she was &quot;invited to follow an amazing yet disconcerting  journey. Her readiness led her to experience a joy of which all previous  generations had sung.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Our 'yes' to God makes the font of true happiness gush forth,&quot; the  Pope affirmed. &quot;It frees the 'I' from everything that closes it in on  itself. It brings the poverty of our lives into the richness and power of God's  plan, without restricting our freedom and our responsibility. [...] It conforms  our lives to Christ's own life.&quot; </p>

  <p>The Holy Father encouraged the young &quot;to celebrate with enthusiasm the joy  of loving Christ and of believing and hoping in him, and to follow with trust  the path of initiation you have before you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I particularly invite you to take up the witness of your ancestors in the  faith, and to learn to welcome the word of God -- in silence and meditation --  so that it can mould your hearts and produce generous fruits in you,&quot; he  added. </p>
  
  <p>This pilgrimage, the Pontiff concluded, &quot;is also a good time to allow  yourselves to be asked by Christ: <strong>'What  do you want to do with your lives?</strong>' May those among you who feel the call  to follow him in the priesthood or in consecrated life -- as have so many young  participants in these pilgrimages -- reply to the Lord's call and put  yourselves totally at the service of the Church, with a life completely  dedicated to the Kingdom of heaven. You will never be disappointed.&quot; </p>

  <p>*  Study conducted in 2003 by Dr. Dean Hoge, and Jacqueline Wenger entitled: <em>Evolving Visions of the Priesthood: Changes  from Vatican II to the Turn of the Century,</em>that concluded: Would you  indicate how important each of the following is as a source of satisfaction to  you? Percent saying: This is of great importance<br />
    - 90% Joy in administering the sacraments and presiding over the  liturgy.<br />
    - 80% Satisfaction in preaching the Word of God.<br />
    - 67% Opportunity to work with  many people and be part of their lives.<br />
    - 62% Being a part of community of Christians who are working  together to share the good news of the gospel.</p>

    Ave  Maria Press is pleased to announce the acquisition of <em><a href="main.html" onclick="var ref = window.open('https://www.avemariapress.com/product/1-59471-274-3/Why-Priests-Are-Happy/', '_blank');">Why Priests Are Happy: A Study of the  Psychological and Spiritual Health of Priests</a></em> by renowned  psychologist Msgr. Stephen J. Rossetti. Now slated to release in October of  2011, this groundbreaking, peer-reviewed study undermines popular notions  that Catholic priests are depressed and unhappy in their vocations. </p>
  
  <p>Rossetti  examines many issues, comparing priests to the general male population with  respect to human intimacy, sexual difficulties, burnout, psychological  problems, physical health and self-care. He identifies the factors that  contribute to happiness among priests as well as those that lead a priest to  consider leaving the priesthood. He also looks closely at the contribution of  spirituality to psychological health, examining thirteen elements of priestly  spirituality. What surfaces is a very human portrait of some very human men who  are imbued with a spirituality that has a direct and profound effect on their  lives. Priests are clearly, and really not surprisingly, normal men. And contrary  to the image portrayed in the media, <strong>92%  say they are happy in the ministry. </strong></p>

<!-----------begin question--------------------->
                
			  <div data-role="collapsible">
                    <h3>A typical priest schedule</h3>
                    
                    <div class="text-info">
              
              <p>
              
          Ask two different priests about their schedule, and you will receive two different answers. Like most professionals, how a priest spends his day ‘at work’ is not necessarily a standard answer. Because priests are individuals with distinct talents and interests, a day can look different for any priest, even those that live in the same rectory!</p>
 
 <p>
That being said, there are also some similarities and a ‘typical’ schedule to a parish priests’ day. For most priests’ ministering in a parish, the average day would look something like this:

</p>
<p>

6am – 8
Rise from sleep and prepare for the celebration of morning mass. Many priests will take advantage of their morning preparation as also their time of personal prayer…which becomes the foundation for their day.

</p>
<p>

 
8 - 10
Typically between these morning hours would be the time that most parishes celebrate the Eucharist. There are also some parishes who celebrate an evening daily mass on one or two days of the week.
 
 </p>
<p>

 
10 – 12
If there is a funeral, this would be the usual time to celebrate the Mass for the deceased and their grieving family. A priest would also utilize this time for office work or preparation for his bulletin article, homily prep, staff development, building issues, visiting the parish school, visit parishioners or perform another ministry within the parish.

</p>
<p>

 
12pm – 1
Everyone needs to eat, so this also true for the parish priest! A little fuel for the body will give him the energy he needs for the remainder of his day. This might also be a time for rest, exercise, or prayer.
 
 
 </p>
<p>

1 – 4
Many people look to their parish priest for assistance and spiritual guidance. During this time, a priest may have several appointments from members of his parish, for reasons ranging from: spiritual direction, staff issues, building issues, school issues, Archdiocesan issues, marriage counseling…..if you can think of a need, a priest will be called upon to offer his help.
</p>
<p>

 
4 – 7
It can be rather difficult to work on a homily while in the office, so many priests will take advantage of this time to return to his rectory to work on those areas of his ministry which require more privacy and less interruptions. He may also use this as a time for prayer, meetings, exercise, or rest. Dinner will be on his agenda as well!
 
 </p>
<p>

 
7 – 10
Depending on the day, this is the time when a priest in a parish meets with his parishioners for the many scheduled meetings which take place. Examples of a parishes monthly meetings would be: Parish Council, Worship/Education/Christian Service/Administration Commissions, School Committee, and any variety of parish organization meetings as well. This would also be a very busy time for a priest to again meet with parishioners, engaged couples, etc.
 
 </p>
<p>

 
10 - ?
After a long day of working ‘in the vineyard’, a priest will find his way back to his rectory for some personal time (reading, music, TV, etc.) and then to bed for a night of hopefully restful sleep.

</p>
<p>


One of his last prayers before his evening comes to a close, comes from Night Prayer in the Liturgy of Hours:
“Protect us Lord as we stay awake, watch over us as we sleep, that awake we may keep watch with Christ, and asleep rest in His peace.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Saturday:</strong>
In addition to his personal prayer, a priest will be ready for the celebration of any combination of the following:  Funeral, Wedding, Baptism, Confession and/or personal appointment(s). The day will culminate with the celebration of the Sunday Vigil Mass.
 </p>
<p>

<strong>Sunday:</strong>
Most priests will celebrate 2-3 masses on a Sunday morning with the people of his parish. The Sunday Eucharist brings together all the people of his faith community: parish staff that assist in the management and ministry of the parish and the many dedicated volunteers who assist in the celebration of the Eucharist each and every Sunday. There might also be parish functions that take place on a Sunday afternoon as well. The remainder of the day might be used for rest or time with family or friends….but mostly rest!

    <li>Write three essays a. what does priesthood mean to me? <br />
      b. why do i want to be a priest? <br />
      c. Why do I want to be a priest in the Archdiocese of Portland? (International seminarians only </li>
    <li>Meet with our Psychologist </li>
    <li>Meet with members of our admission committee for an interview. </li>

	<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="">
					<h3>Our Father</h3>
				Our Father, Who art in heaven, 
Hallowed be Thy Name. 
Thy Kingdom come. 
Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. 
And forgive us our trespasses, 
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.					
					</div>	


<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="">
					<h3>Hail Mary</h3>
Hail Mary,
Full of Grace,
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary,
Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now,
and at the hour of death.
Amen.
		
					</div>	
<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="">
					<h3>Glory Be</h3>
Glory be to the Father,
and to the Son,
and to the Holy Spirit.
As it was in the beginning,
is now,
and ever shall be,
world without end.
Amen.
					</div>	
<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="">
					<h3>Apostle's Creed</h3>
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth;
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son Our Lord,
Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
He descended into Hell; the third day He rose again from the dead;
He ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.
 I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting.

Amen.
					</div>	
<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="">
					<h3>Guardian Angel Prayer</h3>
Angel of God,
my guardian dear,
To whom God's love
commits me here,
Ever this day,
be at my side,
To light and guard,
Rule and guide.
Amen.

	</div>	

<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="">
					<h3>St. Michael the Archangel</h3>
St. Michael the Archangel,
defend us in battle.
Be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the Devil.
May God rebuke Him, we humbly pray,
and do thou,
O Prince of the heavenly hosts,
by the power of God,
thrust into hell Satan,
and all the evil spirits,
who prowl about the world
seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.
	</div>	


<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="">
					<h3>Come Holy Spirit</h3>
Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of Thy faithful and enkindle in them the fire of Thy love.

<p>
<strong>Leader:</strong> Send forth Thy Spirit and they shall be created. <br>
<strong>Response:</strong> And Thou shalt renew the face of the earth.
</p>

Let us pray. O God, Who didst instruct the hearts of the faithful by the light of the Holy Spirit, grant us in the same Spirit to be truly wise, and ever to rejoice in His consolation. Through Christ our Lord.



	</div>	

<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="">
					<h3>Memorare</h3>
Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thine intercession was left unaided.
Inspired by this confidence, I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my mother; to thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in thy mercy hear and answer me. Amen.	</div>


<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="">
					<h3>Magnificat</h3>
					<p>
My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior
for he has looked with favor on His lowly servant.
From this day all generations will call me blessed:
the Almighty has done great things for me,
and holy is His Name.<p>
</p>
He has mercy on those who fear Him
in every generation.
He has shown the strength of His arm,
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.<p>
</p>
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
and has lifted up the lowly.
He has filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he has sent away empty.<p>
</p>
He has come to the help of His servant Israel
for he remembered His promise of mercy,
the promise he made to our fathers,
to Abraham and His children forever. <p>
</p>
(Lk 1:46-55)

					<h3>Hail Holy Queen</h3>

	
	
	Hail, holy Queen, mother of mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To thee do we send up our sighs mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this our exile show us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.

Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God.

That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.
